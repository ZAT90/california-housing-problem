## OverView
The goal of this project is to build a regression model to predict housing prices in California. Using a neural network model, the project predicts the median house value based on features like median income, house age, and average rooms. The notebook includes data loading, model training, and evaluation with Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Techniques Covered
- Neural Network (for regression).
- Regression: Predicting continuous values (house prices).
- Model Evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Data Preprocessing: Feature scaling, splitting data.

## Features
- Neural Network Regression: A regression model using a neural network to predict continuous values (housing prices).
- Metrics: Includes Mean Squared Error (MSE) for model evaluation.
- Data Preprocessing: Includes feature scaling for improved neural network performance.

## Usage
- Load and preprocess the California Housing dataset.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a neural network regression model.
- Evaluate the model and view results.

## Dependencies
```
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
tensorflow

```
## Results
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the accuracy of the model's predictions on the test data.

### Sample Output
```
Mean Squared Error: 0.2799
```
